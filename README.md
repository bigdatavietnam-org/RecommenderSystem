# RecommenderSystem
The project is a dating website recommendation system.
Here we build two collaborative filtering models, KNN and SVD. We select the most popular 10000 male and 1000 female users' ratings from Czech dating site libiseti in 2006 http://www.occamslab.com/petricek/data/ (where poplairy is calculated by the number of rating received).
From the KNN and SVD models, we are able to recommend according to a user's previous rating history.
